You’re in a desert walking along in the sand when all of the sudden you look down, 
and you see a tortoise, crawling toward you. You reach down, you 
flip the tortoise over on its back. The tortoise lays on its back, 
its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over, 
but it can’t, not without your help. But you’re not helping. Why is that?
